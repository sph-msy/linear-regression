# Exercise: Implementing Linear Regression from Scratch

## Objective

This code implements a **Linear Regression** algorithm from scratch. It uses popular Python libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-Learn** to handle data manipulation, visualization, and model evaluation.

## Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For comparison and model evaluation.

## Dataset Used

It uses the **Boston Housing dataset**, which provides information about various housing attributes in Boston and their corresponding house prices. This dataset is widely used for practice in regression tasks.

- **Dataset Source**: [Boston Housing Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altavish/boston-housing-dataset)
  
You can download the dataset and load it for analysis.

### Dataset Description

The Boston Housing dataset consists of the following features:

1. **CRIM**: Crime rate per capita.
2. **ZN**: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots.
3. **INDUS**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
4. **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
5. **NOX**: Nitrogen oxide concentration (parts per 10 million).
6. **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
7. **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.
8. **DIS**: Weighted distance to employment centers.
9. **RAD**: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
10. **TAX**: Property tax rate per $10,000.
11. **PTRATIO**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
12. **B**: Proportion of Black residents by town.
13. **LSTAT**: Percentage of lower status population.
14. **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (Target variable).
